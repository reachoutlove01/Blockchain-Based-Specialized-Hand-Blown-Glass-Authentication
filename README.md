# Blockchain-Based Specialized Hand-Blown Glass Authentication

A decentralized system for authenticating, documenting, and tracking the provenance of hand-blown glass artworks through blockchain verification.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive authentication system for hand-blown glass art using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, validate artistic techniques, and maintain an immutable record of ownership. The system consists of four primary smart contract components:

1. **Artist Verification**: Validates legitimate glass artisans and their credentials
2. **Technique Documentation**: Records specific glassblowing methods and processes
3. **Studio Verification**: Confirms creation in recognized workshops and facilities
4. **Provenance Tracking**: Tracks chain of custody from artist to current owner

## Core Components

### Artist Verification Contract
- Validates identity and credentials of glass artisans:
    - Educational background and apprenticeships
    - Exhibition history and gallery representation
    - Awards and recognition in the field
    - Signature techniques and stylistic elements
- Provides unique digital identifiers for verified glass artists
- Maintains comprehensive artist profiles with portfolio documentation
- Implements peer validation from established glass art community members

### Technique Documentation Contract
- Records specific glassblowing methods employed:
    - Detailed process documentation (furnace work, torch work, kiln forming)
    - Material specifications (type of glass, colorants, additives)
    - Tool usage and specialized equipment
    - Time-temperature profiles and annealing procedures
- Stores technical imagery of creation process
- Documents unique technical innovations or adaptations
- Catalogs technique evolution and development for individual artists

### Studio Verification Contract
- Confirms creation in recognized workshops:
    - Validates established studio facilities and equipment
    - Documents collaborative assistants and team members
    - Verifies access to specialized equipment (furnaces, glory holes, annealing ovens)
    - Records environmental conditions during creation
- Maintains registry of recognized glass studios and their specifications
- Documents studio-specific material formulations or techniques
- Tracks residency programs and guest artist arrangements

### Provenance Contract
- Tracks chain of custody from artist to current owner:
    - Complete ownership timeline with verified transfers
    - Exhibition and display history
    - Conservation treatments and condition reports
    - Appraisals and valuation history
- Links to supporting documentation and certificates
- Manages privacy options for collectors
- Facilitates secure transfers with multi-party verification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16.0.0 or later
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- Ethereum wallet compatible with NFTs
- IPFS for decentralized storage of high-resolution images and documentation

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/glass-authentication.git
cd glass-authentication
npm install
```

### Deployment
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network <your-network>
```

## Use Cases

- **For Artists**: Protect authenticity and document creative processes
- **For Collectors**: Verify provenance and authenticity of acquisitions
- **For Galleries**: Provide verified documentation for exhibited works
- **For Museums**: Maintain comprehensive records of glass art collections
- **For Appraisers**: Access verified creation information for accurate valuation

## Technical Architecture

The system uses ERC-721 non-fungible tokens to represent unique glass artworks, with extended metadata structures linking to detailed documentation. The architecture implements:

- Hierarchical contract relationships connecting artists, techniques, studios, and ownership
- Decentralized storage for high-resolution images and video documentation
- Multi-signature verification for transfers and authenticity claims
- Mobile verification tools for real-time authentication

## Future Development

- Integration with AR/VR for immersive technique documentation
- Implementation of physical authentication markers (micro-etching, embedded NFC)
- Development of specialized condition monitoring for fragile glass works
- Creation of virtual exhibition spaces for authenticated collections
- Community curation and educational resources on glassblowing techniques
